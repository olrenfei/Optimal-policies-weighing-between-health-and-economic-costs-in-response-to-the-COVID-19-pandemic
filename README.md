# Optimal-policies-weighing-between-health-and-economic-costs-in-response-to-the-COVID-19-pandemic
By combining the mobility data and the contact data from field surveys in Shanghai, we build an age-structured metapopulation disease transmission model to depict the transmission process precisely. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed model to quantify the effects of various lockdown policies from both economic and health aspects.
Replication Files:
  Generate the initial age distribution and the initial regional distribution using Initialize.py.
  Estimate parameters using 1103Fit_para_multi_Wu.py.
  Predict daily confirmed cases using Multi_Forecast.py.
  Evaluation of different policies can be done using files in the Policy directory: Policies including (1) uniform lockdowns, (2)   targeted lockdowns based on age, (3) targeted lockdowns based on categories of POIs, (4) targeted lockdowns based on level of     infections, (5) targeted lockdowns based on the combined targeted lockdown based on age and level of infections.
